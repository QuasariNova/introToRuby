You run the following code...

  names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']
  names['margaret'] = 'jody'

...and get the following error message:

  TypeError: no implicit conversion of String into Integer
    from (irb):2:in `[]='
    from (irb):2
    from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

What is the problem and how can it be fixed?

Arrays take an integer index, they are not like hashes that can index based on
a key. So, by trying to replace 'margaret' this way it throws an error.

Theres a couple ways we could fix this. If you know 'margaret's index, which is 3 and also the last index you could do this:

  names[3] = 'jody'

or this

  names.last = 'jody'

If you were sure it was the last index, you could also do one of these:

  names.pop
  names.push 'jody'

or

  names.delete_at 3
  names << 'jody'

However, I assume you might not know where in the array 'margaret' is so you
would have to find the index first, then change it:

index = names.index('margaret')
names[index] = 'jody'

This could be a problem if 'margaret' was used multiple times as only the first
instance would be found.
