What is the value of a, b, and c in the following program?

  string = "Welcome to America!"
  a = string[6]
  b = string[11]
  c = string[19]

Since strings are a collection of characters, the indexer should treat it just
like an array. In that case:
a == 'e'
b == 'A'
I think c should throw an error as the string only has 19 characters, and
indexes start at 0. The last index is 18.
However, in testing it does not throw an error, instead it is assigned nil.
That makes sense, as the index does not exist.
