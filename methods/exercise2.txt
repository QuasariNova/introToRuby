What do the following expressions evaluate to? That is, what value does each expression return?

  1. x = 2

2

  2. puts x = 2

nil

  3. p name = "Joe"

This one is tricky as p returns it's evaluation, unlike puts. Had to run in irb to check. So, it returns "Joe"

  4. four = "four"

"four"

  5. print something = "nothing"

print is like puts and returns nil. I again had to test this in irb to make sure.
