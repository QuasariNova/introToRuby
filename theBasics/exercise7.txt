What does the following error message tell you?

SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

From what we've been taught, this is probably related to a hash being declared. I suspect that instead of ending it with a }, someone mistyped and ended it with a ).


Checking on irb:

irb(main):001:0> {syntax:nil)
Traceback (most recent call last):
        3: from /usr/bin/irb:23:in `<main>'
        2: from /usr/bin/irb:23:in `load'
        1: from /usr/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/gems/irb-1.2.1/exe/irb:11:in `<top (required)>'
SyntaxError ((irb):1: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}')
{syntax:nil)

The error is the same, so it seems like my conclusion is reasonable.
