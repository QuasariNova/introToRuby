# Write a program that outputs the factorial of the numbers 5, 6, 7, and 8.

puts 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
puts 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
puts 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
puts 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

# We technically could remove the * 1, but it's part of the definition of a
# factoral, so whatver. This would probably be easier to make a method with
# a loop doing the math, but we haven't been taught either of those yet.
