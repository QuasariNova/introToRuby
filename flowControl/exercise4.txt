What will each block of code below print to the screen? Write your answer on a
piece of paper or in a text editor and then run each block of code to see if
you were correct.

  # Snippet 1
  '4' == 4 ? puts("TRUE") : puts("FALSE")

The string literal '4' does not equal the integer literal 4, so this ternary is
going to use the false expression, printing "FALSE" to the screen.

  # Snippet 2
  x = 2
  if ((x * 3) / 2) == (4 + 4 - x - 3)
    puts "Did you get it right?"
  else
    puts "Did you?"
  end

x * 3 is 6 and dividing that by 2 gives us 3, while 4 + 4 is 8, minus x is 6,
and minux 3 gives us 6. 6 is equal to 6, so it will print "Did
you get it right?" onto the screen.

  # Snippet 3
  y = 9
  x = 10
  if (x + 1) <= (y)
    puts "Alright."
  elsif (x + 1) >= (y)
    puts "Alright now!"
  elsif (y + 1) == x
    puts "ALRIGHT NOW!"
  else
    puts "Alrighty!"
  end

x + 1 is 11, which is not less than or equal to 9, so we can ignore the first
part of the statement. On the elseif, x+1 is 11, which is greater than or equal
to 9, which means the statement will print "Alright now!" to the screen. While
the next elsif is true, this one already executed, so we ignore everything
after.
