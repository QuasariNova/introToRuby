Look at the following programs. What does x print to the screen in each case?
Do they both give errors? Are the errors different? Why?

  x = 0
  3.times do
    x += 1
  end
  puts x

This program should print 3 to the screen. x is in the outter scope of the 3.
times block, but blocks can work with variables in an outter scope, so this
works just fine.

  y = 0
  3.times do
    y += 1
    x = y
  end
  puts x

This program should have an error. x is declared inside the scope of the
3.times block, so the outer scope has no idea it exists.
