Given the following code...

  x = "hi there"
  my_hash = {x: "some value"}
  my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}

What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?

my_hash has one kvp with a key of :x, which is a symbol.
my_hash2 has one kvp with a key of "hi there", which is a string.

While my_hash2 was passed the variable x as a key, it's the literal that
becomes the key, not the variable itself.
