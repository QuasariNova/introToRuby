What will the following program output?

  hash1 = {shoes: "nike", "hat" => "adidas", :hoodie => true}
  hash2 = {"hat" => "adidas", :shoes => "nike", hoodie: true}

  if hash1 == hash2
    puts "These hashes are the same!"
  else
    puts "These hashes are not the same!"
  end

While hash1 and hash2 had their key value pairs added in different orders, all
keys stored are the same and all values assigned to those keys are the same.
Thus, this will output:
  These hashes are the same!

If you did hash1.keys == hash2.keys, this would not come out the same, due to
them having different orders, however hashes really don't care about order like
arrays do.
